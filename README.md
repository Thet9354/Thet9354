 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Thet's Tech Journey</h3></summary>

My journey as a coder began when I was first introduced to programming through C++ during my undergraduate studies. I was fascinated by how a few lines of code could create a functioning program. This sparked my interest in programming and I knew that I wanted to pursue a career in this field.

After my undergraduate studies, I started exploring different programming niches and soon picked Android app development as my primary focus. I was intrigued by the vast opportunities in this field and the potential to make a positive impact through building innovative apps that could solve real-world problems.

I started by learning the basics of Android app development and soon began working on small-scale projects. As I gained more experience, I began taking on more challenging projects and expanding my skillset. Over the course of three years, I honed my skills and became proficient in developing high-quality, user-friendly, and functional Android applications.

As I continued to develop my Android app development skills, I also started exploring other programming languages and niches. I soon picked up iOS development and expanded my skillset to include other languages such as Java, Swift, HTML, CSS, JS, C, and Python. This helped me to become a well-rounded developer, capable of tackling a variety of projects and challenges.

Today, I am working as an Android app developer, building innovative and impactful apps that make a difference in people's lives. My journey as a coder has been an exciting and rewarding one, and I am constantly learning and growing as a developer.
