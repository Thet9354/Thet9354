Hi, I'm Thet - a passionate application developer with knowledge in both andriod and ios development.
Besides the main language of Java and Swift, i'm also knowledgeable in other varios technical skills such as C, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SQLite.

I'm a software developer who creates thoughts into things through mobile application development. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. All video content is built the same way, from ideation and planning, all the way to finalizing the content with artistic touches.
