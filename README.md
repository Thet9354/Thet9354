 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Thet's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
I started my coding journey as a naive Engineering with Business student with a passion to learn everything I could about the world of tech and business. I first chose this course of study due to the fact that i was unsure of with career path was suited for me. However, slowly i came to learn the pwer of programming and grew a strong passion for it. I self-taught myself android app development first and moved on to ios app development. I dreamt of one day being able to move over and world in the land of the tech, silicon valley where i would be with my kind. Until then , my desire and passion drives me everydy to pick up new challenges, solve new problems and work on side projects.
